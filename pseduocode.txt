Initialize chooseLanguage function header
Initialize chooseSpecialty funciton header

Function main
    Initialize 2 dimensional vector, countries holding the countries 
    Initialize 1 dimensional vector, language holding all languages
    Call chooseLanguage function and initialize returned value into an integer 
    Initialize 1 dimensional vector, specialties holding the medical specialties
    Call chooseSpecialty function and initialize returned value into an integer
    Output thanks 
    Output the chosen language and chooseSpecialty
    Use srand(time(0)) to randomize the srand function so it randomizes different values
    Intialize n with the a random integer with the range of countries in selected language
    Output chosen country based on randomized integer
    Initialize numberOfLanguage to hold the number of languages
    Initialize numberOfCountries to hold the number of countries based on langauge chosen
    Initialize numberOfSpecialties to hold the number of medical specialties

    Output the total possible outcomes
    Output the probability of matching countries
    Output the probability of matching specialties
    Output the total probability based on country, specialty, and language choice
End main function

chooseLanguage function passing in language vector
    intialize languageChoice
    initialize numLanguage to number of elements in language vector
    Do
        Output choose language to user
        For i = 0 to number of langauges
            Output list of langauges 
        Input languageChoice
        if languageChoice larger than numLanguage or smaller than 1
            Output try again
    Until languageChoice smaller than numLanguage or larger than 1
    return languageChoice 
End chooseLanguage function

chooseSpecialty function passing in specialty vector
    Intialize specialization 
    Do
        Output choose medical specialization to user
        For i=0 to number of medical specialties
            Output list of specialties
        Input specialization
        If specialization larger than 8 or larger than 1
            Output try again
    Until specialization smaller than numLanguage or larger than 1
    return specialization
